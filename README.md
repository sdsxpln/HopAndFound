HopAndFound is a thief protection device, which can be used in crowded places like a concert. The system consists of the monitored item (wallet, mobile phone) that you want to protect, the monitor which signals you if your device is lost and stationary nodes. The nodes forward the messages from the monitored item to the monitor, in order to signal it's absence.
